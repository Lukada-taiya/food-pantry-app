# How to contribute to food-pantry-app

Welcome!  As an open source project, contributions are welcome to help make the project better.  Generally, contributions fall into the following categories:

## Bug reports
If something is not working the way you expect, or the way it was intended and needs to be fixed, please open an issue https://github.com/ncosd/food-pantry-app/issues/new/choose following the Bug Report template.   Information about how to reproduce the bug is essential to ensure it is fixed as fast as possible.

## Feature Requests
If something is missing, and you really think it should be added, then open an https://github.com/ncosd/food-pantry-app/issues/new/choose for a Feature Request.  If you plan to create a pull request and build it, please call that out in the issue.

# Getting Started
To get started running the Food Pantry App locally, follow the instructions for setting up your [development environment](https://github.com/ncosd/food-pantry-app?tab=readme-ov-file#developing).   To contribute code, you should fork the https://github.com/ncosd/food-pantry-app repository and develop your fix in a branch other than `main`, and open a pull request from your branch to `ncosd/food-pantry-app/branches/main` or the current branch named `dev-vX.Y.Z`.

## Development workflow
Branch `main` holds the current stable version of the project.   Each release is tagged with a version number like `v1.7.0`.  Work done between releases is done on a branch from `main` named with the word `dev-` and the version number of the next release, for example `dev-v1.8.0`.  If you are working on code, it is a good practice to create a branch from the `dev-vX.Y.Z` branch named `issue#-short-description-in-a-word-or-two` and do your work there.  When you open a pull request, target it at the `ncosd/food-pantry-app/branches/dev-vX.Y.Z` branch for the next release.

# Pull Requests
Pull requests are welcome, and will be reviewed.   If you are new to open source development there are many resources on github, and [this guide](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/how-to-contribute-to-open-source) can be helpful with getting started.
