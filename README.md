# ShoppingList
Website for the shopping list

The NCFB shopping list application is designed to:

 * let customers choose the items they would like
 * keep track of items in inventory so customers cannot choose something no longer in inventory
 * keep track of what items were given out during a distribution day
 * keep track of items added to inventory during a collection day

The shopping list application consists of several parts:

 * an html5 application showing the inventory items available during a distribution time
 * an inventory application which allows staff to mark items as available, and specify the
   quantity available during a distribution time
 * an analytics application to track inventory collection and disbursements over time
